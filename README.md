## Common Questions

### Why does Buy-Bot stop after reaching a prompt for 2FA authentication when logging in to my account?
   - Buy-Bot isn't built to handle 2FA. If you receive a prompt from Amazon or Best Buy that an authentication email / text has been sent, verify that you're logging in then restart the bot.

### Why does Buy-Bot stop after reaching the checkout page?
   - Buy-Bot **does not** handle your address or credit card information, so please make sure that your default name, address, payment method, and shipping method are already set in your Best Buy or Amazon account. The "Place your order" button should be visible during checkout.
